        "As with all deep learning algorithms, neural style transfer defines a loss function then minimizes it. Suppose we have a function $C$ to measure content and a function $S$ to measure style, as well as measures of distance between of two images $x$ and $y$ for content and style, denoted by $L_c(x, y)$ and $L_s(x, y)$ respectively. Then the loss function $L$ is as below, where $k$ is the content image, $m$ is the style image, and $n$ is the generated output image (the variable to minimize over).\n",

        "In order to get both the content and style representations of our image, we will look at some intermediate layers within our model. As we go deeper into the model, these intermediate layers represent higher and higher order features. In this case, we are using the network architecture [VGG19](https://keras.io/applications/#vgg19), a pretrained image classification network. These intermediate layers are necessary to define the representation of content and style from our images. For an input image, we will try to match the corresponding style and content target representations at these intermediate layers. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, why do these intermediate outputs within our pretrained image classification network allow us to define style and content representations? At a high level, this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that in order for a network to perform image classification (which our network has been trained to do), it must understand the image. This involves taking the raw image as input pixels and building an internal representation via functions that turn the raw image pixels into an understanding of the features present within the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is also partly why convolutional neural networks are able to generalize well. They are able to capture the invariances and defining features within classes (e.g. cats vs dogs) that are agnostic to background noise and other nuisances. Therefore, somewhere between where the raw image is input and the classification label is output, the model serves as a complex feature extractor. So by accessing intermediate layers, we’re able to describe the content and style of input images. \n",
