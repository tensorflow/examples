        "In this notebook, we will create a **vanilla autoencoder** model using the [TensorFlow subclassing API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras#model_subclassing). We are going to use the popular [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (Grayscale images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9).\n",
        "\n",
        "We deal with huge amount of data in machine learning which naturally leads to more computations. However, we can pick the parts of the data which contribute the most to a model's learning, thus leading to less computations. The process of choosing the _important_ parts of data is known as _feature selection_, which is among the number of use cases of an _autoencoder_.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what exactly is an autoencoder? Well, let's first recall that a neural network is a computational model that is used for finding a function describing the relationship between data features $x$ and its values or labels $y$, i.e. $y = f(x)$. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, an autoencoder is also a neural network. But instead of finding the function _mapping the features_ $x$ to their _corresponding values or labels_ $y$, it aims to find the function mapping the _features_ $x$ _to itself_ $x$. Wait, what? Why would we do that?\n",
