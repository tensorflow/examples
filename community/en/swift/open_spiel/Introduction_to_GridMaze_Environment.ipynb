        "# GridMaze Environment\n",
        "This environment enables you to create and learn to solve grid mazes.\n",
        "Solving mazes is a nice problem to start with when learning the basics of reinforcement learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "The problem description of the GridMaze environment is that you have a Robot located on a starting cell in a grid maze world. \n",
        "By moving Up, Down, Left, or Right, the robot should figure out the best strategy to move from the start cell to the goal cell of the maze.\n",
        "The robot gets a reward (positive value) or a cost (negative value) when moving to a new cell. The purpose of the game is for the robot to figure out how to move from the start to goal position and getting as much reward (or as little cost) as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each cell in the grid world have different functions:\n",
        "* **SPACE**: The robot is free to enter this cell, but there is a at a certain cost for doing so (e.g. -1).\n",
        "* **START**: This is where the robot starts, like SPACE it can also be entered (returned to), at a cost. A maze must only have one START cell.\n",
        "* **GOAL**: The robot successfully solves the maze and typically gets a reward by walking to this cell. A maze can have more than one goal cell.\n",
        "* **WALL**: This cell cannot be entered.\n",
        "* **BOUNCE**: The robot can attempt to enter this cell, but doing so will make it bounce back to the cell it came from, and get the associated reward/cost of that cell.\n",
        "* **HOLE**: The robot enters this cell at a typically big cost, and the game is over. In other words, it fails to reach the GOAL cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at an example:\n",
        "![ExampleImage](Images/GridMazeExample.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Describing each location in the maze by [row,column]:\n",
        "* Robot starts out in cell [1,1]. From this cell it can only move right or down, since a wall cell cannot be entered. Going right or down will cost -1.\n",
        "* The goal cell is at [4,4]. Entering this cell gives the robot 10 in reward, and the robot has successfully solve the maze (the T menas terminal cell).\n",
        "* Entering the hole in [2,2] will cost the robot -100 and it is a terminal state (game over). Since robot did not reach goal cell, it lost. Likewise for the hole at [3,4].\n",
        "* Entering one of the space cells at position [2,3] and [3,2] each has a cost of -2.\n",
        "* The space cell at [4,0] is a bit special. Since the cell at [4,5] is also space, it means the robot can go left in [4,0] and end up in [4,5]. Had [4,5] been a wall, going left from [4,0] would not have been a legal action.\n",
        "* Cell [4,2] is a bounce cell. This means attempting to enter it from [3,2], [4,1], or [4,3] results in robot bouncing back to those cells. Cost will be -2 from [3,2] and -1 from [4,1] and [4,3].\n",
        "\n",
        "Now what about the white arrows with 50%? This indicates that cell [2,4] has random behavior.\n",
        "If the robot attempts to enter cell [2,4], it will with 50% probability end up in that cell, but it might also well end up in cell [3,4] with 50% probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it for an overview of the environment, let's look at how interact with the environment through code!\n",
