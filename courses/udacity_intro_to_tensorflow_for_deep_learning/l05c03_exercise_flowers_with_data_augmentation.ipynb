Feel free to experiment by changing as many parameters as you like. For example, you can add more convolutional layers, or more fully connected layers. You can also experiment with different filter sizes in your convolutional layers, different number of units in your fully connected layers, different dropout rates, etc... You can also experiment by performing image augmentation with more image transformations that we have seen so far. Take a look at the [ImageDataGenerator Documentation](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/) to see a full list of all the available image transformations. For example, you can add shear transformations, or you can vary the brightness of the images, etc... Experiment as much as you can and compare the accuracy of your various models. Which parameters give you the best result?"
