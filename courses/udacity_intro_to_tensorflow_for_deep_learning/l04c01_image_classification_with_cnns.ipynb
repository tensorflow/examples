After that, the 32 outputs are reduced in size using a MaxPooling2D (2,2) with a stride of 2. The next Conv2D also has a (3,3) kernel, takes the 32 images as input and creates 64 outputs which are again reduced in size by a MaxPooling2D layer. So far in the course, we have described what a Convolution does, but we haven't yet covered how you chain multiples of these together. We will get back to this in lesson 4 when we use color images.
