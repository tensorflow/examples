"""Public APIs for TFLite Model Maker, a transfer learning library to train custom TFLite models.

You can install the package with

```bash
pip install tflite-model-maker
```

Typical usage of Model Maker is to create a model in a few lines of code, e.g.:

```python
from tflite_model_maker import image_classifier
from tflite_model_maker.image_classifier import DataLoader

# Load input data specific to an on-device ML app.
data = DataLoader.from_folder('flower_photos/')
train_data, test_data = data.split(0.9)

# Customize the TensorFlow model.
model = image_classifier.create(train_data)

# Evaluate the model.
accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data)

# Export to Tensorflow Lite model and label file in `export_dir`.
model.export(export_dir='/tmp/')
```

For more details, please refer to our guide:
