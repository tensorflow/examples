### What we build

- Create a webpage that uses machine learning directly in the web browser via TensorFlow.js to classify and detect common objects, (yes, including more than one at a time), from a live webcam stream.
- Supercharge your regular webcam to identify objects and get the coordinates of the bounding box for each object it finds
- Highlight the found object in the video stream
