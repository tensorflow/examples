// Choosing to pass in a floatBuffer as opposed to using [self.ringBuffer floatBuffer]
// to avoid creating an extra memcpy.
// TFLFloatBuffer free's its float *data when it deallocates. Accessing
// [self.ringBuffer floatBuffer] inside this method will cause the returned float*
// to be deallocated when this method call completes and hence will warrant a
// copy of the float * to the cAudioBuffer.
// Instead the classify() of TFLAudioClassifier calls [audioTensor floatBuffer]
// and passes it into this method which will prevent the float* from being deallocated
// until classify() method completes.
